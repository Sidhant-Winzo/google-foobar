Only stage 3 is mentioned. Code is modified so that even if you read a thousand time and compile a billion time, it won't work!

One of the problem is particularly hard:
dooms_day: 
	Fraction class and Linear Algebra class
	Markov chain, LU Decomposition, Inverse Matrix
find_the_access_codes:
	pure Array problems
bomb_baby:
	BigInteger and recursive similar to GCD
